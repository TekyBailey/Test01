# Test01
Date Created: 12 Feb 2026

### Purpose
This repository will be used to test a GitHub pages deployment using a simple HTML/CSS website. The deployment method will be from a branch instead of by GitHub Actions. The selected branch for deployment is the main branch.

### Notes
1. How you name your repository affects how the url is generated. For example I named this repository "Test01" and the url generated was "https://tekybailey.github.io/Test01/". I have 2 observations about this:
- You have to type the link exactly as displayed from the pages tab. No www.tekybailey.github.io/Test01/ is allowed.
- Capitalization is enforced (at least in the chrome browser) in the url. So https://tekybailey.github.io/test01/ will not work.
